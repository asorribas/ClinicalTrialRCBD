# RCBD

This is a Shiny app for simulating Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

## Instructions

Users can define an scenario for a RCBD. THis includes:

- Minimum effect to detect
- Within treatment variability
- Number of blocks and replicates
- Block effect

Then the app allows to explore the following questions:

- Results of an experiment
- ANOVA analysis
- Statistical power
- Optimal number of blocks and replicates for attaining statistical power
- Optimal number of blocks and replicates for attaining precision in treatemnt effects estimation
