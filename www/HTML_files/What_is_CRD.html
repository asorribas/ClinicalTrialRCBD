<h1>Completely Randomized Design (CRD)</h1>
<p>A <strong>Completely Randomized Design (CRD)</strong> is the simplest
type of experimental design.<br />
In a CRD, all experimental units are assigned to treatments completely
at random, so every unit has an equal chance of receiving any
treatment.</p>

<h3>When to Use a CRD</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s used when experimental units are <strong>homogeneous</strong>
(similar in all relevant aspects).<br />
</li>
<li>The model assumes that observed differences between treatment means
are due to <strong>treatment effects and random error</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Analysis is typically done using a <strong>one-way ANOVA</strong>,
where total variability is partitioned into <em>between treatments</em>
and <em>within treatments (error)</em>.</li>

<h3>🔑 Key Features of a Completely Randomized Design (CRD)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Random Assignment</strong> – Experimental units are assigned
to treatments entirely at random, ensuring unbiased treatment
comparisons.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Homogeneous Units</strong> – Assumes all experimental units
are similar, so differences in responses are mainly due to
treatments.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Number of Replicates</strong> – Treatments can have
equal or unequal numbers of replicates.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Single Source of Variation</strong> – Only one factor (the
treatment) is studied; all other variation is treated as random
error.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Simple Analysis</strong> – Data are analyzed using a one-way
ANOVA, comparing treatment means.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Implementation</strong> – It’s the easiest design to
set up and interpret when conditions are uniform.</li>
</ul>
