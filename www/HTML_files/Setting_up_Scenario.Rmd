### Why It Is Important to Set Up a Scenario in an RCBD

When designing a **Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)**, simply knowing that blocks reduce variability is not enough.  
To understand how and why blocking improves your study, it is essential to define a **realistic scenario**—one that reflects the actual sources of variability in your experiment.

### Core Assumptions in an RCBD

- **Treatment Effects:** Treatments may differ in their mean effects (the effect you want to detect).
- **Block Effects:** Blocks differ systematically due to some external factor (e.g., patients, days, batches, field locations).

By clearly defining these two sources of variation, the design becomes **meaningful and interpretable**.

### Practical Checklist (use before data collection)

- Identify the **blocking factor** that most strongly drives background variability.
- Justify why experimental units within each block are **internally homogeneous**.
- Ensure each treatment appears **once per block** (complete blocks).
- Plan **randomization within blocks** to avoid allocation bias.
- Anticipate the **ANOVA model** (treatment and block effects) you will fit.
