<h1>Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)</h1>
<p>A <strong>Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)</strong> is an
experimental design commonly used in agriculture, biomedicine, and other
applied research areas where it is important to control for variability
in experimental conditions.</p>
<p>In an RCBD, experimental units are grouped into
<strong>blocks</strong> based on a factor believed to influence the
response, and each treatment appears once in every block.</p>

<h3>🔑 Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blocking to Control Variability</strong><br />
A block is a group of experimental units that are similar with respect
to some characteristic that may affect the outcome (e.g., soil type in
agricultural studies or patient demographic groups in clinical
trials).<br />
By organizing similar units into blocks, the design reduces the impact
of this source of variability on the results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Randomization within Blocks</strong><br />
Within each block, the treatments are assigned randomly to experimental
units.<br />
This prevents systematic bias and helps ensure that differences in
outcomes can be attributed to the treatments rather than to uncontrolled
factors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design Structure</strong><br />
In an RCBD, each treatment appears exactly once per block.<br />
This ensures a fair and balanced comparison of treatments across
different levels of the blocking factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong><br />
Data from an RCBD are typically analyzed using <strong>Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA)</strong>.<br />
The model partitions the total variability into variability due to
treatments and variability due to blocks.<br />
This allows researchers to detect treatment differences while accounting
for block effects.</p></li>
