<h3>Why It Is Important to Set Up a Scenario in an RCBD</h3>
<p>When designing a <strong>Randomized Complete Block Design
(RCBD)</strong>, simply knowing that blocks reduce variability is not
enough.<br />
To understand how and why blocking improves your study, it is essential
to define a <strong>realistic scenario</strong>—one that reflects the
actual sources of variability in your experiment.</p>

<div id="core-assumptions-in-an-rcbd" class="section level3">
<h3>Core Assumptions in an RCBD</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treatment Effects:</strong> Treatments may differ in their
mean effects (the effect you want to detect).</li>
<li><strong>Block Effects:</strong> Blocks differ systematically due to
some external factor (e.g., patients, days, batches, field
locations).</li>
</ul>
<p>By clearly defining these two sources of variation, the design
becomes <strong>meaningful and interpretable</strong>.</p>

<h3>Practical Checklist (use before data collection)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the <strong>blocking factor</strong> that most strongly
drives background variability.</li>
<li>Justify why experimental units within each block are
<strong>internally homogeneous</strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure each treatment appears <strong>once per block</strong>
(complete blocks).</li>
<li>Plan <strong>randomization within blocks</strong> to avoid
allocation bias.</li>
<li>Anticipate the <strong>ANOVA model</strong> (treatment and block
effects) you will fit.</li>
</ul>
