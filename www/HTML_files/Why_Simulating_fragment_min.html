<h3>Why Simulating an Scenario Helps</h3>
<p>Simulation allows us to <strong>see the benefit of blocking</strong>
in an RCBD.<br />
In particular, it lets us compare two situations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Analyzing the data using an RCBD</strong> (blocking
properly)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring blocks</strong> and treating the experiment as a
<strong>Completely Randomized Design (CRD)</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>🔍 What We Observe in Simulations</h3>
<p>When we simulate data with substantial block-to-block variability, we
typically find:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RCBD maintains good power</strong> to detect treatment
differences, because the block variability is separated out and does not
inflate the residual noise.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>CRD loses power</strong>, because block differences get
absorbed into the residual error, making treatments look more similar
than they actually are.</li>
</ul>

<h3>📊 Conclusion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Blocking reduces unexplained variability.</strong><br />
If blocks are ignored, the experiment becomes noisier, making true
differences harder to detect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simulating both designs side by side provides valuable intuition for
students and researchers, showing how <strong>proper blocking improves
precision and statistical power</strong>.</p>
