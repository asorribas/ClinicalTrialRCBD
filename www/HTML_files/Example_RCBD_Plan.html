<h1>Example of a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)</h1>
<p>Consider a study conducted to evaluate the <strong>consistency and
accuracy of blood analysis results</strong> for a specific metabolite
measured by three different laboratories.<br />
The goal is to standardize procedures and ensure that the results are
comparable across laboratories.</p>
<hr />
<p>In this example, the <strong>laboratories</strong> act as a
<strong>fixed factor</strong> (analogous to treatments), while the
<strong>blood samples from each patient</strong> serve as
<strong>blocks</strong>.<br />
Because each patient may have unique biological characteristics that
influence metabolite levels, <strong>blocking by patient</strong>
accounts for this inherent subject-to-subject variability.</p>
<hr />
<p>Each blood sample is divided into <strong>three equal
aliquots</strong>, and each aliquot is randomly assigned to one of the
three laboratories for analysis.<br />
This ensures that every laboratory measures the same set of samples,
allowing for a fair comparison.</p>
<hr />
<div id="objective-of-the-study" class="section level3">
<h3>🎯 Objective of the Study</h3>
<p>The objective of the study is to determine whether the measurements
differ significantly among the three laboratories.<br />
If statistically significant differences are detected, this would
suggest that <strong>laboratory procedures are not yet fully
standardized</strong> and require further improvement.</p>

<p>Each <strong>row</strong> represents a patient (block), and each
<strong>column</strong> represents the random assignment of the three
laboratories (treatments) to that patient’s aliquots.<br />
Every laboratory analyzes one aliquot per patient, ensuring a balanced
design with one observation per treatment-block combination.</p>
