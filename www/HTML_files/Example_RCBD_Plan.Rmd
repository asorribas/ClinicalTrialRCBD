# Example of a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

Consider a study conducted to evaluate the **consistency and accuracy of blood analysis results** for a specific metabolite measured by three different laboratories.  
The goal is to standardize procedures and ensure that the results are comparable across laboratories.

---

In this example, the **laboratories** act as a **fixed factor** (analogous to treatments), while the **blood samples from each patient** serve as **blocks**.  
Because each patient may have unique biological characteristics that influence metabolite levels, **blocking by patient** accounts for this inherent subject-to-subject variability.

---

Each blood sample is divided into **three equal aliquots**, and each aliquot is randomly assigned to one of the three laboratories for analysis.  
This ensures that every laboratory measures the same set of samples, allowing for a fair comparison.

---

### 🎯 Objective of the Study

The objective of the study is to determine whether the measurements differ significantly among the three laboratories.  
If statistically significant differences are detected, this would suggest that **laboratory procedures are not yet fully standardized** and require further improvement.

### 🧪 Experimental Layout

| Patient (Block) | Sample 1 | Sample 2 | Sample 3 |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| **Patient 1** | Lab A | Lab B | Lab C |
| **Patient 2** | Lab C | Lab A | Lab B |
| **Patient 3** | Lab B | Lab C | Lab A |
| **Patient 4** | Lab A | Lab C | Lab B |
| **Patient 5** | Lab B | Lab A | Lab C |

Each **row** represents a patient (block), and each **column** represents the random assignment of the three laboratories (treatments) to that patient’s aliquots.  
Every laboratory analyzes one aliquot per patient, ensuring a balanced design with one observation per treatment-block combination.
