# Completely Randomized Design (CRD)

A **Completely Randomized Design (CRD)** is the simplest type of experimental design.  
In a CRD, all experimental units are assigned to treatments completely at random, so every unit has an equal chance of receiving any treatment.

### When to Use a CRD

- It’s used when experimental units are **homogeneous** (similar in all relevant aspects).  
- The model assumes that observed differences between treatment means are due to **treatment effects and random error**.  
- Analysis is typically done using a **one-way ANOVA**, where total variability is partitioned into *between treatments* and *within treatments (error)*.

### 🔑 Key Features of a Completely Randomized Design (CRD)

- **Random Assignment** – Experimental units are assigned to treatments entirely at random, ensuring unbiased treatment comparisons.  
- **Homogeneous Units** – Assumes all experimental units are similar, so differences in responses are mainly due to treatments.  
- **Flexible Number of Replicates** – Treatments can have equal or unequal numbers of replicates.  
- **Single Source of Variation** – Only one factor (the treatment) is studied; all other variation is treated as random error.  
- **Simple Analysis** – Data are analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, comparing treatment means.  
- **Ease of Implementation** – It’s the easiest design to set up and interpret when conditions are uniform.
