<h1>Example of a CRD experimental plan</h1>
<p>Consider a study designed to evaluate the effect of three types of
fertilizers on the growth of a particular crop species grown under
controlled greenhouse conditions. The goal is to determine whether the
fertilizers produce different mean plant heights after a fixed growth
period.</p>
<p>In this example, the fertilizer type is the treatment factor, with
three levels (Fertilizer A, B, and C). The experimental units are potted
plants of the same species, age, and initial size, all grown under
identical environmental conditions (light, temperature, and watering).
Because the plants are highly homogeneous, a Completely Randomized
Design (CRD) is appropriate.</p>
<p>Each plant is randomly assigned to one of the three fertilizer
treatments. This ensures that every plant has an equal chance of
receiving any fertilizer, eliminating bias and making the comparison
among fertilizers fair.</p>
<p>The objective of the study is to determine whether the mean plant
height differs significantly among fertilizers. If significant
differences are found, researchers can identify which fertilizer leads
to optimal growth.</p>
