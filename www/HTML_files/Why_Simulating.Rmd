### Why Simulating an Scenario Helps

Simulation allows us to **see the benefit of blocking** in an RCBD.  
In particular, it lets us compare two situations:

1. **Analyzing the data using an RCBD** (blocking properly)  
2. **Ignoring blocks** and treating the experiment as a **Completely Randomized Design (CRD)**

### 🔍 What We Observe in Simulations

When we simulate data with substantial block-to-block variability, we typically find:

- **RCBD maintains good power** to detect treatment differences, because the block variability is separated out and does not inflate the residual noise.  
- **CRD loses power**, because block differences get absorbed into the residual error, making treatments look more similar than they actually are.

### 📊 Conclusion

> **Blocking reduces unexplained variability.**  
> If blocks are ignored, the experiment becomes noisier, making true differences harder to detect.

Simulating both designs side by side provides valuable intuition for students and researchers, showing how **proper blocking improves precision and statistical power**.
