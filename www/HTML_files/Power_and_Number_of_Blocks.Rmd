This plot shows how statistical power increases as the number of replicates grows
when using a number of blocks (slider) in a randomized complete block design. The curve rises quickly at first
and then begins to level off, meaning that each additional replicate contributes less and
less improvement in power. In other words, there are diminishing returns once power is already high.

## Dependence on blocks:</b>
  
Including blocks removes variation due to known sources of heterogeneity (e.g., location, time, batches).
When block effects are strong, this reduction in unexplained variability can <b>substantially increase power</b>
without increasing the number of treatment replicates. However, adding more blocks also increases total
experimental effort, so the number of blocks should reflect meaningful sources of variation rather than
being increased arbitrarily.

## Dependence on replicates:
  
Increasing the number of replicates per treatment improves the accuracy of treatment mean estimates
and therefore increases power. But, as shown here, the gain in power is most noticeable when going from
very few replicates to a moderate number; after that, the curve flattens and additional replicates yield
only small improvements.

## How to choose a good combination:
  
Identify important blocking variables first. Use blocks to capture variation you can predict or measure
(e.g., field rows, days, animal batches). Aim for a number of blocks that meaningfully reduces variability,
but avoid unnecessary blocking if no strong block differences exist. Once blocks are set, adjust the number
of replicates to achieve the desired power (commonly 0.80 or higher).
Look for the point where the power curve starts to flatten—this indicates an efficient number
of replicates (good power for a reasonable sample size).
Consider practical constraints such as cost, time, and availability of experimental units.

### In short:

Use blocks to reduce noise, improving power without needing as many replicates.
Increase replicates until reaching the desired power, but recognize that beyond a certain point
the improvement becomes minimal.
