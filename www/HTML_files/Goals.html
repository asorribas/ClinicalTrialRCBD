<h2>What is the purpose of this app? HOLE</h2>
<p>This app has been designed for simulating a Randomized Complete Block
Design (RCBD) and for exploring the different aspects that determines
the results. This is a <strong>SIMULATION</strong> tool and
<u><strong>it is not a tool for analyzing real data</strong></u>. The
app simulates experiments using a set of parameters defined by the
user.</p>

<div id="what-is-a-simulation" class="section level2">
<h2>What is a simulation?</h2>
<p>A simulation is a computational experiment used to mimic the process
of conducting the experiment many times under known or assumed
conditions.</p>
<p>It allows researchers or students to understand how random variation,
block effects, and treatment differences influence the analysis of
variance (ANOVA) results and conclusions — without actually performing
the physical experiment.</p>
<p>A simulation helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualize variability due to random errors and blocking.</li>
<li>Evaluate the power of detecting treatment differences under
different levels of variability.</li>
<li>Explore robustness of the design when assumptions (like homogeneity
of variance or normality) are violated.</li>
<li>Understand sampling distributions of test statistics (e.g.,
F-ratios).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggested workflow for using the app</h2>
<p>You can use this app in different ways, but a suggested workflow can
help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your problem. How many treatments? How many blocks? Do blocks
have an important variability? Can you obtain replicates? Which is the
treatmet effect (set a value for within sigma and chose a value for
Cohen’s f)</li>
<li>Introduce the parameter values in the app</li>
<li>Generate data</li>
<li>Explore the estucture of the data according to the experimental
design. Try to understand the difference between RCBD and CRD.</li>
<li>Compare the analysis in both cases.</li>
<li>Compare the confidence intervals for the pairwise comparison of
treatment’s effects.</li>
<li>Compute statistical power. What does it mean?</li>
<li>Explore the effect of increasing the number of blocks and replicates
on statistical power.</li>
<li>Explore precision on the pairwise estimation of effects.</li>
</ul>
